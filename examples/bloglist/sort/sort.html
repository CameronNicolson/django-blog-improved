<p>The sort key changes the order which the posts are presented.</p>
<p>Sort is a choice-based option, the options are:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>asc - stands for ascending (a-z)</li>
	<li>desc - stands for descending (z-a)</li>
</ol>
<p>These options are not case sensitive with uppercase and lowercase both considered equal, such as "DESC" vs "desc" - gives the same result.
<h2>Standard sorting</h2>
<p>When the "sort" option is discluded then the posts are arranged by publish dates, with the newest post appearing at the top.</p>
<div id="preview" class="pt-4">
{% bloglist %}

<h2>Sort by ascending</h2>
<p>Sort by ascending means arranging items from the smallest or lowest value to the largest or highest value.</p> 
{% bloglist sort='asc' %}
<h2>Sort and featured</h2>
<pre class="pre">
<code class="code">
  &#123;&#37; bloglist sort='asc' featured='True' &#37;&#125;
</code>
</pre>
<p>When combining sort and featuerd options, the lists are generated with both featured and alphabetical sorting. Featured posts bare higher importance to any other list element.</p>
{% bloglist sort='asc' featured='True' %}
<p>In this example, the featured title "Yearly Roundup" came before "Web Series" since they are compared based on numerical importance instead of alphabetical.
</div>
<pre class="pre">
<code class="code">
  &#123;&#37; bloglist sort='asc' featured='True' featured_count='3' &#37;&#125;
</code>
</pre>

{% bloglist sort='asc' featured='True' featured_count='3' %}
<p>The example above shows the featured posts being dealt chronologically, the most recent "Yearly roundup 2024" is placed at the top, then the remaining sort is done alphabetically.
